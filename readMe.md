<h2>User Story</h2>

As a player, 
<ul>
  <li>I want to play a fun and challenging game where I have to guess a secret word in order to launch a spaceship.</li>
  <li>I want the game to be easy to understand and visually appealing, with a cool space-themed design.</li>
  <li>When I start the game, I want to see a picture of a spaceship that is grounded and waiting to take off.</li>
  <li>I want to see a series of blank spaces on the screen that represent the secret word I need to guess.</li>
  <li>As I guess letters, I want the game to tell me if the letter is in the secret word or not.</li>
  <li>If I guess a correct letter, I want to see that letter revealed in the corresponding blank space(s) on the screen.</li>
  <li>If I guess an incorrect letter, I want to see a part of the spaceship light up or change color to indicate that I'm one step closer to losing the game.</li>
  <li>If I guess all the letters in the secret word before the spaceship is fully lit up or colored in, I want to see the spaceship take off and fly away into space.</li>
  <li>I want to see a victory message on the screen and have the option to play again.</li>
  <li>If I lose the game before guessing all the letters, I want to see a defeat message and the correct word displayed on the screen, and also have the option to play again.</li>
 </ul>
